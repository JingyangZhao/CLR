Where:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#J = number of customers
#I = number of potential facilities
Q = vehicle capacity
g = fixed cost per used vehicle

v = variable cost by transported demand
LB = Lower bound (0 if not available)
UB = Upper bound (0 if not available)
ic = 0 if costs are are calculated as euclidean distance, 1 if calculated as ceil(euclidean distance), 2 if calculated as round(euclidean distance)

n = node number (1 <= n <= #J for customers, #J+1 <= n <= #J + #I for facilities)
x = x-coordinate of node
y = y-coordinate of node
d_n = demand of customer n
f_n = fixed cost of opening facility n - #J

b_n = capacity of facility n - #J
k_n = maximum number of vehicles assigned to facility n - #J. This value is actually not used anywhere.
